"""
Utilities for loading pre-trained LeRobot policies from various sources.

This module makes it easy to:
1. Load BC (Behavioral Cloning) policies trained with train_act.py
2. Initialize DAgger training with these pre-trained policies
3. Load policies from local checkpoints or W&B artifacts
4. Maintain compatibility with LeRobot's policy loading

Designed specifically for the BC -> DAgger -> RL training pipeline.
